## Predictive Modeling Part 1

This repo contains the final project as well as final exam of our R-based Predictive Modeling class from Summer 2019.

The final exam was a take-home exam with a collection of exercises and questions testing our knowledge of supervised learning concepts learned in the class. The folder contains the exam questions, all datasets used in the exam, as well as the R script I used in answering the exam. Because the exam used some problems for our textbook, I have also attached an online copy of the book provided free of charge from the authors.

The final project was a group project that required the delivery of a slide deck, report, and all associated R code used in the project. The folder will contain our submitted slide deck, report, dataset, and R Markdown file that aggregates all R scripts we used in the modeling portion of our project.
