## Predictive Modeling Part 1

This repo contains the final project as well as final exam of our R-based Predictive Modeling class from Summer 2019.

The final exam was a take-home exam with a collection of exercises and questions testing our knowledge of supervised learning concepts learned in the class.

The final project was a group project that required the delivery of a slide deck, report, and all associated R code used in the project.
