## Predictive Modeling Part 1

This repo contains the final project as well as final exam of our R-based Predictive Modeling class from Summer 2019.

The final exam was a take-home exam with a collection of exercises and questions testing our knowledge of supervised learning concepts learned in the class. The folder contains the exam questions, all datasets used in the exam, as well as the R script I used in answering the exam.

The final project was a group project that required the delivery of a slide deck, report, and all associated R code used in the project. The folder will contain our slide deck, report, and datasets used along with the collection of R scripts we used to create various models for the project.
